== Purpose ==
AutoWikiFire (AWF) aims, ideally, to wikify a text with the syntax of MediaWiki from a text written either by a newbie who don't know the wikisyntax either by experienced MediaWiki users who find it is speeder to use this tool than wikify themselves a page.
AWF is primarily designed specifically for the French-speaking Wikipedia although a attempt has been made to have a program as general as possible, and to make the per-wiki specificities configurable per wiki.


== Components ==

AWF has be designed to have a number of (independant) components:
* Decoffrage: a French word I use to speak of the phase which transform a raw article into a somewhat viewable article, typically raw lists beginning with `-';
* Linker: engine which add wikilinks (with the help of the database);
* Interwikizer: engine which add interwikis (with the help of the databases);
* Categorizer: engine which add categories (with the help of the database);

There is also a common basis: the representation of the Text with its properties.


== Execution ==

You must have PHP installed and, if you want an UI, a web server which can execute a PHP script (for instance Apache).

=== Command line ===
